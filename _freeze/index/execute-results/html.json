The [website](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/index.html) is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the complete source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/ISLR-tidymodels-labs).\n\nThis version of the book was built with R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31) and Quarto version 1.6.42 and the following packages:\n\n\n\n\n\n|package      |version |source                                                                   |\n|:------------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|broom        |1.0.8   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|corrr        |0.4.4   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|dials        |1.4.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|discrim      |1.0.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|downlit      |0.4.4   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|dplyr        |1.1.4   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|factoextra   |1.0.7   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|ggplot2      |3.5.2   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|glmnet       |4.1-8   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|infer        |1.0.7   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|ISLR         |1.4     |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|ISLR2        |1.3-2   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|kernlab      |0.9-33  |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|kknn         |1.3.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|klaR         |1.7-3   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|MASS         |7.3-65  |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|mclust       |6.1.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|mixOmics     |6.31.4  |Github (mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics\\@40581c54a16e1b48dfaec430fe76026570df3b6e) |\n|modeldata    |1.4.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|paletteer    |1.6.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|parsnip      |1.3.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|patchwork    |1.3.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|poissonreg   |1.0.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|proxy        |0.4-27  |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|purrr        |1.0.4   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|randomForest |4.7-1.2 |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|readr        |2.1.5   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|recipes      |1.2.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|rmarkdown    |2.29    |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|rpart        |4.1.24  |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|rpart.plot   |3.1.2   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|rsample      |1.3.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|scico        |1.5.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|tibble       |3.2.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|tidyclust    |0.2.4   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|tidymodels   |1.3.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|tidyr        |1.3.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|tune         |1.3.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|vip          |0.4.1   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|workflows    |1.2.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|workflowsets |1.1.0   |CRAN (R 4.4.0)                                                           |\n|xgboost      |1.7.9.1 |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n|yardstick    |1.3.2   |CRAN (R 4.4.1)                                                           |\n",
